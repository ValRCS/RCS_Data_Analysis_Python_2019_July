### Assumptions of linear regression: 

* There must be a linear relation between independent and dependent variables. 
* There should not be any outliers present. 
* No heteroscedasticity - variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it

* Sample observations should be independent. 
* Error terms should be normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance. 
* Absence of multicollinearity and auto-correlation
