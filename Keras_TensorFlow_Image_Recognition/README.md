## What is Deep Learning?



Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. 

In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound.

Cutting edge of cutting edge in current AI reasearch

While deep learning was first theorized in the 1980s, there are two main reasons it has only recently become useful:

* Deep learning requires large amounts of labeled data. For example, driverless car development requires millions of images and thousands of hours of video.
* Deep learning requires substantial computing power. High-performance GPUs have a parallel architecture that is efficient for deep learning. When combined with clusters or cloud computing, this enables development teams to reduce training time for a deep learning network from weeks to hours or less.

It is practical to use tf.keras unless you want the pain of reading TensorFlow documentation...
