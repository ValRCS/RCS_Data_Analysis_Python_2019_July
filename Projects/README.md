# Various Ideas for Course Projects

## Best Projects are ones you have a personal/business interest in!



## Good Data Sciene project would consist of

* Gathering data from various sources(databases, csvs, JSON APIs, web scraping etc)
* Cleaning Data (outliers, missing data, etc)
* Combining Data from various sources
* Exploratory Analysis
* Deciding on which methods to use (simple statistics, regressions, maybe some more advanced ML algorithms)
  * Classification
  * Regression 
  * Optimization
* Visualizing Data (we will look a building a Dashboard at the end)
